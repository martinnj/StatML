Linear Discriminant Analysis with $m>2$ classes is done by creating a
discriminant function for each class and running each function on all points we
wish to classify. The discimination functions calculates the posterior
propability that a point belongs to its class, and so the one with the highest
propability is chosen.
The discrimination function for a class $k$ looks like this:
\[
  \delta_k(x) = x^\text{T}\Sigma^{-1}\mu_k - \frac{1}{2}\mu^{\text{t}}_k\Sigma^{-1}\mu_k + \text{ln Pr}(Y = C_k)
\]
The prior distribution is calculated like so
\[
  \text{Pr}(Y = C_k) = \ell_k / \ell
\]
Where $\ell$ is the number of elements in the training data, and $\ell_k$ is the
number of elements of class $k$ in the training data. $\mu_k$ is the mean of a
given class, while $\Sigma$ as the covariance matrix for each class added
together and normalized. They're calculated like so:
\begin{align*}
  \mu_k  &= \frac{1}{\ell_k}\sum_{(x,y) \in S_k}x \\
  \Sigma &= \frac{1}{\ell - m}\sum_{k=1}^{m}\sum_{(x,y) \in S_k}(x-\mu_k)(x-\mu_k)^{\text{T}}
\end{align*}
Where $S_k$ is the points in the training set that corresponds to the class $k$
and $m$ is the number of classes.

Using this method we managed to get an $XXX\%$ accuracy on the training data and
$XXX\%$ for the test data.
