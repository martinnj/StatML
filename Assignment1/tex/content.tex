\section*{I.1.1.7}
The rank of $A = 1$, because the rows are linearly dependent. We can verify this by observing
that the third row can produce the first and second rows with a multiple, e.g. the first row (3 6 6)
is the same as the third row (1 2 2) x 3.

\section*{I.1.1.8}
As $A$ is not full rank, it is not invertible.

\section*{I.1.2.1}
The derivative of $f(w) = (wx + b)^2$ with respect to $w$ is
\[
	(wx+b)^2 = w^2 x^2 + 2wxb+b^2 = \\

	2x(xw + b)
\]

\section*{I.1.2.2}
In general
\[
	\left ( \frac{f}{g} \right )' (x) = \frac{f'(x) \cdot g(x) - f(x) \cdot g'(x)}{(g(x))^2}
\]

Therefore, differentiating for w we get:
\begin{align*}
	f(x) &= 1 \\
	f'(x) &= 0 \\
	g(x) &= (wx+b)^2 \\
	g'(x) &= 2x(wx+b) \\
	\left ( \frac{f}{g} \right )' (w) &= \frac{0 \cdot (wx+b)^2 - 1 \cdot 2x(wx+b)}{((wx+b)^2)^2} \\

	f(x) &= x \\
	g(x) &= e^x \\
	\left ( f \cdot g \right )' (x) &= 1e^x + xe^x

The l2 norm of $x$ is 
\begin{align*}
	mean  &= \begin{pmatrix}1 & 2\end{pmatrix}^T \\
	\mu   &= \begin{pmatrix}1.0006 & 1.9834\end{pmatrix}^T \\
	||x|| &= l2(mean - \mu) = 0.0366
\end{align*}
where $l2()$ is a function that calculates the \textit{Euclidean norm} or l2 norm of the vector $mean - \mu$.

Figure~\ref{fig:I.2.3} plots the points drawn along with a red circle for the calculated mean and a green circle
for $\mu$. There is a difference between the two because the mean is calculated based on the generated data drawn
from the multivariate gaussian distribution at random. If we had a number of points approaching infinite, the difference
would approach 0.

\section*{I.2.4}
The covariance matrix is full rank 2 and thus has two eigenvectors and eigenvalues. Each eigenvector represents
a principal component (or linearly uncorrelated variable), and each eigenvalue a scalar representing the variance.
Intuitively, the eigenvectors form a scaled and translated coordinate system centered at the mean of the multivariate
Gaussian distribution ($\mu$). If an eigenvalue is 0, the dimensionality is reduced by one. The larger of the two
eigenvector/value pairs represents the direction where the ellipsis is widest.

The covariance matrix we calculated can be found in Eq~\ref{eq:cov}. Figure~\ref{fig:I.2.4.1} shows a plot of the Multivariate
gaussian distribution, plotted with the mean, $\mu$ and the two eigenvectors centered in the distribution $\mu$. Figure~\ref{fig:I.2.4.1.rot}
shows a plot of the 3 rotated distributions along with the distribution rotated to match the largest eigenvector along the x-axis. The
angle needed for this was $-37.2564^o$ in our case.

Given:
\begin{align*}
	\mu = \begin{pmatrix}
		\mu_a \\
		\mu_b \\
		\mu_c
	\end{pmatrix} \quad
	x = \begin{pmatrix}
		x_a \\
		x_b \\
		x_c
	\end{pmatrix} \quad
	\Sigma = \begin{bmatrix}
		\Sigma_{aa} & \Sigma_{ab} & \Sigma_{ac} \\
		\Sigma_{ba} & \Sigma_{bb} & \Sigma_{bc} \\
		\Sigma_{ca} & \Sigma_{cb} & \Sigma_{cc}
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
We wish to discover an expression for the conditional distribution $p(x_a|x_b)$ in which
$x_c$ has been marginalized out. We first find an expression for $p(x_a|x_b)$ and then marginalize
out $x_c$.

We partition $\mu$, $x$ and $\Sigma$ as follows:
\begin{align*}
	\mu &= \begin{pmatrix}
		\mu_d \\
		\mu_c
	\end{pmatrix}, \text{where } \mu_d = \begin{pmatrix}\mu_a \\ \mu_b \end{pmatrix} \\
	\overline{x} &= \begin{pmatrix}
		x_d \\
		x_c
	\end{pmatrix}, \text{where } x_d = \begin{pmatrix}x_a \\ x_b \end{pmatrix} \\
	\Sigma &= \begin{bmatrix}
		\Sigma_{aad} & \Sigma_{abd} \\
		\Sigma_{bad} & \Sigma_{bbd} \\
	\end{bmatrix} \\
	\text{where } \Sigma_{aad} &= \begin{bmatrix}
		\Sigma_{aa} & \Sigma_{ab} \\
		\Sigma_{ba} & \Sigma_{bb}
	\end{bmatrix} \\
	\text{and } \Sigma_{abd} &= \begin{bmatrix}
		\Sigma_{ac} \\ \Sigma_{bc}
	\end{bmatrix} \\
	\text{and } \Sigma_{bad} &= \begin{bmatrix}
		\Sigma_{ca} & \Sigma_{cb} 
	\end{bmatrix} \\
	\text{and } \Sigma_{bbd} &= \begin{bmatrix} \Sigma_{cc} \end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}

We also partition the precision matrix 
(inverse of the covariance matrix), as:
\begin{align}
	\Lambda &\equiv \Sigma^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix}
		\Lambda_{aa} & \Lambda_{ab} \\
		\Lambda_{ba} & \Lambda_{bb}		
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
\textit{Note: This recasts our problem to be to find a conditional distribution
$p(x_d|x_c)$ and then to marginalize $x_c$ out}

A conditional distribution can be evaluated from the joint distribution
$p(x) = p(x_d, x_c)$ by fixing $x_c$ and normalizing. We know from \cite{book}
that if a joint distribution $p(x_d, x_c)$ is Gaussian, then the conditional distribution
$p(x_d|x_c)$ is also Gaussian. 

We wish to find
 $p(x_d | x_c)$, by considering the quadratic form in the exponent of the Gaussian distribution:

\begin{align}
	& -\frac{1}{2} (x - \mu)^T \Sigma^{-1}(x - \mu) = \label{eq:2.70}\\
	& -\frac{1}{2} (x_d - \mu_d)^T \Lambda_{aa} (x_d - \mu_d) \notag \\
	& -\frac{1}{2} (x_d - \mu_d)^T \Lambda_{ab} (x_c - \mu_c) \notag \\
	& -\frac{1}{2} (x_c - \mu_c)^T \Lambda_{ba} (x_d - \mu_d) \notag \\
	& -\frac{1}{2} (x_c - \mu_c)^T \Lambda_{bb} (x_c - \mu_c) \notag
\end{align}

A Gaussian distribution is completely characterized by its mean and covariance, so
we must find expressions for the mean and covariance of $p(x_d|x_c)$, by completing
the square. We denote the mean and covariance of this distribution by $\mu_{d|c}$ and
$\Sigma_{d|c}$ respectively. By considering the functional dependence of Eq~\ref{eq:2.70}
on $x_d$ in which $x_c$ is regarded as a constant, we pick out all terms that are second
order in $x_d$:
\begin{align}
	-\frac{1}{2} x_d^T \Lambda_{aa} x_d
\end{align}
From which we have that $\Sigma_{d|c} = \Lambda_{aa}^{-1}$. The terms in
Eq~\ref{eq:2.70} which are linear in $x_d$ are $x_d^T \left \{ \Lambda_{aa}
\mu_d - \Lambda_{a}(x_c - \mu_c) \right \}$, making use of the fact that
$\Lambda_{ba}^T = \Lambda_{ab}$ (See \cite[p.85]{book}). The coefficient of
$x_d$ in this expression is equal to $\Sigma_{d|c}^{-1} \mu_{d|c}$ and so:

\begin{align}
	\mu_{d|c} &= \Sigma_{d|c} \left\{ \Lambda_{aa} \mu_{d} - \Lambda_{ab}(x_c - \mu_c) \right\} \notag \\
		  &= \mu_d - \Lambda_{aa}^{-1} \Lambda_{ab}(x_c - \mu_c) \label{eq:2.75}
\end{align}

Making use of the \textit{Schur complement} of a matrix\cite[p.87]{book}, we have that:
\begin{align*}
	\Lambda_{aa} &= (\Sigma_{aa} - \Sigma_{ab} \Sigma_{bb}^{-1} \Sigma_{ba})^{-1} \\
	\Lambda_{ab} &= -(\Sigma_{aa} - \Sigma_{ab} \Sigma_{bb}^{-1} \Sigma_{ba})^{-1} \Sigma_{ab} \Sigma_{bb}^{-1}
\end{align*}

From these we now have the following for the mean and covariance of $p(x_d|x_c)$:
\begin{align}
	\mu_{d|c} &= \mu_d + \Sigma_{ab} \Sigma_{bb}^{-1} (x_c - \mu_c) \\
	\Sigma_{d|c} &= \Sigma_{aa} - \Sigma_{ab} \Sigma_{bb}^{-1} \Sigma_{ba}
\end{align}

We must now find the margina distribution given by
\begin{align*}
	p(x_d) = \int p(x_d, x_c) \ dx_c
\end{align*}

We complete the square to integrate out $x_c$. The terms involving $x_c$ are:
\begin{align*}
	-\frac{1}{2} x_c^T \Lambda_{bb} x_c + x_c^T m = \\
	-\frac{1}{2} (x_c - \Lambda_{bb}^{-1} m)^T \Lambda_{bb} (x_c - \Lambda_{bb}^{-1} m)
	+\frac{1}{2} m^T \Lambda_{bb}^{-1} m
\end{align*}
Where $m = \Lambda_{bb} \mu_c - \Lambda_{ba} (x_d - \mu_d)$. This is again a standard quadratic form,
and we note that the integration becomes an integral over an unnormalized Gaussian, whereby the result
is the reciprocal of the normalization coefficient\cite[p. 88]{book}. The normalization coefficient depends
only on the determinant of the covariance matrix, so we can integrate out $x_c$ and the only term remaining
that depends on $x_d$ is $m$. Combined with the remaining terms from Eq~\ref{eq:2.70} that depend on $x_d$ we
have:
\begin{align*}
	\frac{1}{2} & [ \Lambda_{bb} \mu_c - \Lambda_{ba} (x_d - \mu_d)]^T \Lambda_{bb}^{-1} [\Lambda_{bb} \mu_c - \Lambda_{ba}(x_d - \mu_d)] \\
	-\frac{1}{2} & x_d^T \Lambda_{aa} x_d + x_d^T (\Lambda_{aa} \mu_d + \Lambda_{ab} \mu_c) + \text{const} \\
	= -\frac{1}{2} & x_d^T(\Lambda_{aa} - \Lambda_{ab} \Lambda_{bb}^{-1} \Lambda_{ba}) x_d \\
	+ & x_d^T (\Lambda_{aa} - \Lambda_{ab} \Lambda_{bb}^{-1} \Lambda_{ba})^{-1} \mu_d + \text{const}
\end{align*}
Where `const' is quantities independent of $x_d$. The covariance and mean of the marginal distribution $p(x_d)$ are thus
\begin{align*}
	\Sigma_d &= (\Lambda_{aa} - \Lambda_{ab} \Lambda_{bb}^{-1} \Lambda_{ba})^{-1} \\
	\mu_d &= \Sigma_d (\Lambda_{aa} - \Lambda_{ab} \Lambda_{bb}^{-1} \Lambda_{ba}) \mu_d = \mu_d \quad \text{(See \cite[p.89,Eq~2.89]{book})}
\end{align*}
Making use of the \textit{Schur complement} again we have that
$(\Lambda_{aa} - \Lambda_{ab} \Lambda_{bb}^{-1} \Lambda_{ba})^{-1} = \Sigma_{aa}$. Finally we have that
$\mathbb{E}[x_d] = \mu_d$ and $\text{cov}[x_d] = \Sigma_{aa}$. Intuitively, to obtain the marginal distribution over
a subset of multivariate normal random variables, we drop the variables we want to marginalize out from the mean
and covariance.

\section{I.4}
\subsection{I.4.1}
The result of our KNN implementation for different k-values and datasets is
shown in Table \ref{tab:knn-results}. The file that generates these results is
\texttt{kNN\_run.m}, it will setup the experiment and do the classifying using
the funktion defined in \texttt{kNN.m}.
\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Description          & $K$-value & Accuracy in \% \\\hline
Run on training data & 1         & $100  \%$ \\
Run on test data     & 1         & $81.5 \%$ \\
Run on training data & 3         & $86.0 \%$ \\
Run on test data     & 3         & $81.5 \%$ \\
Run on training data & 5         & $83.0 \%$ \\
Run on test data     & 5         & $68.4 \%$
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:knn-results}
\end{table}

With $K=1$ and running against the training set, the accuracy is 100\% since any
entry will be matched against itself, and only itself. We also see a general
loss of accuracy as $K$ increases, this is because the point gets matched up
against a larger and larger part of the total points, meaning it will become
more likely to be classified as the type of point there is occuring most times
in the training set.


\subsection{I.4.2}
The program run for this experiment is \texttt{fivefold\_val.m}, it will use aux
functions from \texttt{kNN.m}, \texttt{shuffleSplit.m} and
\texttt{bucketJoiner.m}. We first split the training data using the
\texttt{shuffleSplit} function, it creates a cell-table that contains a
specified number of ``subsets'' that collectively is the entire training set,
but where the indices of the data is shuffled. We then assemble these parts into
2 sets, one that is 1/5 of the data, which will be used as a testing set, and
one with 4/5 of the data, which is the training set.  using five different
partitions of the data (with the above method) we used the \texttt{kNN} function
from the previous subsection to benchmark the different $K$ values with 5
``different training sets''.

During this test, a $K$ value of $5$ gets the best accuracy, around 80\%, but
when run against the actual training set, which have not been used or considered
in the above process, the accuracy drops to $68,4\%$. This is the same accuracy
we got from $K=5$ in the previous section.

\subsection{I.4.3}
The program used for this experiment is \texttt{fivefold\_val\_normalized.m} which
is similar to the above experiment, except it also utilizes \texttt{scale.m} to
normalize the test data.  The $(\text{mean},\text{var})$ of the training data
is: $(3.0288,7.8218)$, the test data after the normalization have the values
$(0.1545,1.0000)$. The most optimal $K$ value is still 5, but the accuracy have
increased to $71,05\%$ when using the normalized test set.
